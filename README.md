# Simon's Game

## how the Simon game works??

- Firstly, the game shows the first color in the sequence (blue). The user clicks on the blue button.

- Next, the game shows the next color (red), the user has to remember the sequence is blue, red and so on and so forth.

- If the user messes up the sequence, then the game ends.
